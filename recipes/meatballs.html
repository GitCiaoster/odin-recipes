        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>Are you in a time crunch and don't know what cook
            for dinner for your family? Meatballs are your answer!
            Don't just take it from us, take it from our community
            who say they "loved this recipe!"
        </p>

        <p>If you are looking to store the meatballs,
            you can place them in a shallow, airtight container
            and in the refrigerator for up to four days.
            Additionally, you can also freze them! Flash freeze
            the cooked meatballs on a baking sheet for a few hours
            or up to overnightm then transfer them to a freezer-safe
            container. You can also freeze the meatballs prior to cooking!

                    cup at a time, until mixture is moist but still
                    holds its shape (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water);
                    shape into meatballs.
